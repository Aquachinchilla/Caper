<p>Profile: Because they came into self-awareness very gradually over decades, little is known for sure about Magnum Opus' origins. What they do know is that they were painted in the nineteenth century by an unknown artist who poured so much of their passion and heart into their greatest work that upon completion they dropped dead on the spot, and their masterpiece was given life. Magnum has only ever shown their true form to two humans. The survivor is still hospitalized.</p>
