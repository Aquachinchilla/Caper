        <p>Profile: Rook hails from an alternate future known as the Age of Dominus, in which only the most powerful variants and superhumans were given human rights and all baseline humans or superhumans found to be insufficiently powerful were treated as subhuman slaves. Through unknown means Rook escaped to the past in order to avert this future, emerging in the period now known as the Bronze Generation. Rook was accepted into the fold of the Improbable Unmen, implying that she is a variant though no ability has been made public. She earned a CCA license and is believed to have engaged in some government employment for a time. This license (and likely her government employment) was revoked when she detonated a VENOM affiliated base with many members and known supervillains inside. She is also suspected of [Redacted]. Currently she is the Combat Training teacher for Halcyon Academy, perhaps as a sort of community service to avoid jail time.</p>
