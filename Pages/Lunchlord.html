        <p>Profile: The scion of a fleeting union between antihero Coldsnap and antivillain Firestarter, A.C.'s powers and ambitions both seem inevitable. Despite repeated attempts, however, he has not yet received full credentials for vigilante activity, nor has he conquered the school, surpassed the Exemplars, or single-handedly defeated the villainous organization VENOM. Will he someday accomplish any or all of these goals? Only time will tell. Currently he rules Halcyon Academy's Cafeteria with an iron fist, as part of an arrangement to earn more CCA credits.</p>
