    <h1>Society of Justice Warriors</h1>
    <p>The Society of Justice Warriors is sponsored by Caper in accordance with our reformed policies and values. Despite certain controversies and allegations regarding our partners, the CCA, Caper is working to make crime-fighting inclusive and non-discriminatory based on personal characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity, among others. Tomorrow's heroes are more diverse than ever, and they're streaming today!</p>

        <p>Affiliations: Leader of Society of Justice Warriors, Caper</p>
        <p>Abilities: Induced Hallucinogenic Euphoria</p>
        <p>Profile: Found in the woods as a child and raised by travelling Romani, Pan can only speculate about his origins and abilities. He was determined from a young age to come to Halcyon City to learn to control his powers to help others. Upon doing so he was quickly discovered by Caper, who saw great potential in his decision to live proudly and openly as a pansexual trans man. Their sponsorship has already paid off, as he has turned out to be an excellent leader for the SJWs and a talented entertainer on his <strong>livestreams</strong> every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8:00 PM here on Caper!</p>

        <p>Abilities: Skilled Marksman, Trick Guns</p>
        <p>Profile: Trigger has always struggled with a world that isn't designed for people like him. His asexuality has often made him an outcast from his peers. His left-handedness makes the usage of basic tools into a challenge. His color-blindness prevents him from enjoying many activities that most people take for granted. He's never given up though, and using his cleverly crafted nonlethal trick guns with expert marksmanship, he's still ready to take on the world. Check out his <strong>livestreams</strong> every Sunday at 8:00 PM here on Caper!</p>

        <p>Identity:(She/Her), Variant, United States</p>
        <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
        <p>Signature Look: Blue/Pink/White</p>
        <p>Affiliations: Society of Justice Warriors, Caper</p>
        <p>Abilities: Portal Generation, Pocket Dimension Storage</p>
        <p>Profile: Alisha Wright was a promising young track and field athlete and straight-A student whose life was tragically changed on the day that her variant abilities manifested. She was in class when portals began to appear around her, transporting her classmates and much of the classroom to a then-unknown location. Initially she was unable to control these powers, and indeed was not immediately aware that she was the source of the occurence. Unfortunately the police were called by her teacher, and they quickly deduced that she was the variant responsible. In the ensuing panic, one of the officers fired upon her, resulting in a spinal injury which would render her paraplegic. While recovering from her wounds in the hospital, she was able to take better control of her abilities, and safely returned everyone from the pocket dimension they'd been stored in. Learn more in her <strong>livestreams</strong> every Tuesday at 8:00 PM here on Caper!</p>

        <p>Real Name: Lien Thi Nguyen</p>
        <p>CCA: Restricted</p>
        <p>Identity:(She/Her), Human, Vietnam</p>
        <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
        <p>Signature Look:Pink/Orange/White (Lesbian Flag Colors) Catsuit</p>
        <p>Affiliations: Society of Justice Warriors, Caper/p>
        <p>Abilities: Silence Field</p>
        <p>Profile: Lien Thi Nguyen was born deaf, but she never let that stop her from excelling in education and athletics. She would be the first to tell you that there is nothing wrong with her and her disability does not hold her back. Unfortunately, her uncle disagreed. He kidnapped her in order to perform experiments to "cure" her deafness, "for her own good". She ultimately broke free, but not before a strange side-effect of the experiment gave her the ability to psionically manipulate a sound nullifying barrier. Now able to even the odds, she's come to Halcyon Academy to learn to control her abilities, and joined the Society of Justice Warriors along the way. Tune in to Cancel's <strong>livestreams</strong> with guests Soothsayer, Kage, and Jorogumo for lessons in ASL every Saturday at 8:00 PM here on Caper!</p>

        <p>Real Name: Ilona Verley</p>
        <p>CCA: Restricted</p>
        <p>Identity:(They/Them), Variant, Nlaka'pamux Tribe</p>
        <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
        <p>Signature Look: Casual Attire, Mostly Earth Tones, Red Handprint on White Shirt</p>
        <p>Affiliations: Society of Justice Warriors, Caper</p>
        <p>Abilities: Dream Manipulation, Astral Projection</p>
        <p>Profile: Ilona has requested we include the following message without alteration: "Two Spirit means a lot of different things, it's basically just a way to make the hugely varied queer traditions of indigenous peoples easier for white folks to understand. It doesn't literally mean I have two souls or anything. In my case it basically means I'm nonbinary, but it's different for everyone. Do your own research. While you're at it, look up MMIW and Native Hope. Donate if you can, it's more useful than land acknowledgements. Oh and my powers aren't traditional spiritual magic or anything, it's just the variant powers I happen to have." If you're lucky you can catch Woke appearing in one of their teammate's livestreams!</p>
