        <p>Profile: Agent Caldwell Wing has always wanted to make the world a better and safter place. Because her only power is her variant trait of having birdlike wings and flight; she found it difficult to compete with the superhuman vigilantes endemic to Halcyon City. After [redacted] she decided that the supervision and training of metahumans was insufficient, and joined A.E.G.I.S. to help. Once again her birdlike wings made things difficult for her, as they made covert work nearly impossible.[redacted]. She instead became a public spokesperson for A.E.G.I.S. so that she could use her striking appearance to aid the cause. She is currently operating as Vice-Principal of Halcyon Academy as part of a deal struck with Principal Surge to keep the students safe (as well as keep the nearby civilians safe from the students).</p>
