    <h1>Noblesse Oblige</h1>
    <p>Driven by their conviction that those with wealth, beauty, popularity, and power are obligated to help those beneath them, it's only a matter of time before this team shows us why they're the best of the best.</p>
    <h3>Avalon</h3>

    <p>Real Name: Alison Crestmere</p>
    <p>CCA: No</p>
    <p>Identity:(She/Her), Human, English</p>
    <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
    <p>Signature Look: Purple Hair, currently Union Jack patterned costume but has posted updates regarding an upcoming purple and gold look</p>
    <p>Affiliations: Leader of Nobless Oblige, Lady of the Lake, British Monarchy (?), Duke of Norfolk (Uncle)</p>
    <p>Abilities: Wields Excalibur and the magic it imbues, specifics unknown</p>
    <p>Profile: Initially an ordinary, beautiful, wealthy, young noble, everything changed for Alison when she was granted the sword Excalibur by the Lady of the Lake. Rightfully the queen of the United Kingdom (citation needed), Alison was faced with three problems: The British Monarchy does not recognize the authority of the Lady of the Lake, the Queen of England doesn't have enough power to be worth starting a civil war, and superpowered entities are generally frowned upon in Britain. Wisely, Alison adopted the name Avalon and absconded to Halcyon City to learn the extent of her new mystic powers amongst her superhuman peers.</p>
    <h3>Victory</h3>

    <p>Real Name: Victor Vance</p>
    <p>CCA: No</p>
    <p>Identity:(He/Him), Variant, United States</p>
    <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
    <p>Signature Look: Red/Blue/White/Gold, Padded Costume Inspired by Football Uniforms</p>
    <p>Affiliations: Professor Cassandra Vance (grandmother), Mosaic (father), Dr. Sheila Supreme (Mother), Belladonna (girlfriend)</p>
    <p>Abilities: Superhuman Strength, Speed, Flight, Laser Vision, Near-Invulnerability, Unconfirmed Superhuman Intelligence, Suspected Telepathy</p>
    <p>Profile: Grandson of Cassandra Vance, the founder of the Improbable Unmen. Son of the brilliant Dr. Sheila Supreme and the notorious sometimes-hero, sometimes-multiversal-threat Mosaic. The world has been watching Victor closely all his life, waiting to see whether he would be the greatest hero of his generation, the world's new greatest threat, or worst of all, a disappointment. So far all signs point to the former. With an impressive slate of powers and a winning personality to match, Victor has shown no signs of letting the pressure get to him. In fact he seems to thrive in the limelight! His only vocal complaint regarding his position as scion of the Vance family is his inability to compete in sports, due to recent fairness laws restricting metahumans from competing.</p>

    <p>Image of an actual Starling as a placeholder</p>

    <p>Abilities: Vocal Mimicry, Hypnotic Singing</p>
    <p>Profile: While Sarah Starling's rise to fame as a pop idol are chronicled in countless entertainment magazines and pre-teen blogs around the world, her decision to attend Halcyon Academy and apply for a CCA license came as a shock to her fans. Her bad-girl-of-pop persona has contributed to fears that she could be the next Cygnus. Still, she has continued to release chart topping singles like "Improbably, Yours" and "Superspeed Rendezvous", assuring fans that she can indeed do it all.</p>
