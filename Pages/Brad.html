    <p>Profile: The most Radical dude in school! He's too legit to quit, but also not legit enough to graduate. A senior of Halcyon Academy's Hero Course for [Redacted]years, Bradical doesn't need to be held back by lame things like a "team" or "homework". Brad has the best skate tricks! He's even good at tricks with those Tech Deck things! Also he has nearly complete control over his own body and a wicked fast healing factor! So Cool!</p>
