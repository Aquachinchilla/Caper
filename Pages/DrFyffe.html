        <p>Abilities: Leading Expert in Suprology</p>
        <p>Profile: Dr. Genevieve Fyffe has a PhD in Suprology and is widely considered to be the world's leading expert on both the elusive properties of Improbium and the physiology of variants. In the case of the former she confirmed that Improbium does not emit radiation but rather an entropy rejecting wave which can be detected from large, even extraplanar or extratemporal, distances. She also disproved claims that variants are a separate Genus or even species, though the inaccurate term Hetero sapiens still sees common usage. Currently Dr. Fyffe is teaching at both Halcyon Academy and Halcyon University while still pursuing independent research on the irregularity of aging in variants. She has increasingly made headlines in recent years for making hostile remarks towards licensed costumed vigilantes such as the Exemplars, claiming that they have failed to effect any real positive change and even that they do more harm than good.</p>
