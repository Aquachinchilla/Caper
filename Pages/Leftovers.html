    <h1>Leftovers</h1>
    <p>While these students initially banded together in the face of rejection from their peers, these wildcards may be forth keeping a glowing eye on.</p>
    <h3>Celestia</h3>

    <p>Real Name: Alicia Grant</p>
    <p>CCA: No</p>
    <p>Identity:(She/Her), Human, United States</p>
    <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
    <p>Signature Look: Translucent blue skin, Black/White, hooded</p>
    <p>Affiliations: Daughter of Dr. Gregory Grant; Best friend of Gale (Blue Eagle Scouts)</p>
    <p>Abilities: Density Manipulation</p>
    <p>Profile: First and only successful recipient of the disgraced Dr. Grant's experimental program for creating superhumans. Empowered by unknown cosmic rays with extraordinarily potent manipulation of molecular density. Known to be capable of creating micro-black holes, vaporizing objects, and limited phasing. Celestia's difficulty controlling her own overwhelming power has worked against her in the past, but her winning personality and work ethic are sure to make her a major player some day.</p>
    <h3>Rain Riot</h3>

    <p>Real Name: Ashley "Rain" Duponte</p>
    <p>CCA: No</p>
    <p>Identity:(She/Her), Variant, United States</p>
    <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
    <p>Signature Look: Black/Pink Punk Attire</p>
    <p>Affiliations: Daughter of Reginald and Lilith Duponte; Sister of Caleb Duponte; Forget-Me-Nots (band)</p>
    <p>Abilities: Illusion, Teleportation</p>
    <p>Profile: Rebellious daughter of the illustrious Duponte family. Rain's illusions and short range teleportation have allowed her to keep her vigilantism a secret (why is this information on a diagetic profile page that is established to be publicly available in-universe? Don't worry about it. -ed). When Rain isn't fighting crime or causing trouble around school she's usually writing poetry, stakeboarding, practicing with the Forget-Me-Nots, or volunteering at the local animal shelter. Perhaps one of her superpowers is multitasking?</p>
    <h3>Silver Dust</h3>

    <p>Real Name: ?</p>
    <p>CCA: No</p>
    <p>Identity:(He/Him), ?, United States?</p>
    <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
    <p>Signature Look: Black/Silver Containment Suit</p>
    <p>Affiliations: Forget-Me-Nots (band), Unknown connection to Victor Vance</p>
    <p>Abilities: Memory Manipulation</p>
    <p>Profile: Due to the incident that resulted in Silver and seemingly many others in his vicinity having their memories alterred, very little is known about his history. What is known is that both his powers and the aforementioned incidents seemed to result from coming in contact with a sample of refined improbium. It is theorized this improbium had undergone a refinement process in order to be more harmful to the Silver Savior (known to be in the area at the time). Very little else is currently known about this enigmatic individual, though he has reportedly formed a garage band called the Forget-Me-Nots.</p>
