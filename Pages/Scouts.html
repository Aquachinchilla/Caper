    <h1>Blue Eagle Scouts</h1>
    <p>The Blue Eagle Scouts are founded and mentored by the Bronze Generation hero and mayoral candidate, Blue Eagle. More than a mere publicity stunt, the Scouts represent Blue Eagle's promise that superhumans are the ideal enforcers of law and order. With their powers and adequate training they are able to combat, solve, and even prevent crimes far more effectively and safely than baseline human police officers, at a fraction of the budget. Of course, it doesn't hurt to be photographed shaking hands with the next generation of superheroes.</p>

    <img src=../Images/Slim.jpg alt="Stock image of teenage boy with bowtie">
    <p>Real Name: Vernon "Slim" Scott</p>
    <p>CCA: No</p>
    <p>Identity:(He/Him), Human, United States</p>
    <p>Generation: Silicon</p>
    <p>Signature Look: Frequently changing along with codename, usually Blue/Yellow</p>
    <p>Affiliations: Field Leader of Blue Eagle Scouts, Blue Eagle (Mentor)</p>
    <p>Abilities: Phasing through solid objects</p>
    <p>Profile: As a child, Slim was a bit of a loner. He had a strong sense of justice that made it difficult to see eye to eye with his peers, and led to him being targetted by bullies. He took self-defense classes in which he quickly revealed himself to be a prodigy in martial arts. Perhaps the confidence he gained from this is why he jumped to the aid of his hero Blue Eagle during a deadly confrontation with the sorceress Lady Faust. Caught in the crossfire, Slim was banished to Limbo by a stray spell. In the aftermath of the fight, Lady Faust revealed that something had gone wrong and even she could not bring him back. Months later, after being presumed dead; Slim reappeared under his own power, with the ability to partially phase between our plane and Limbo at will! With this newfound power, Slim is finally able to bring his sense of justice and work ethic to good use, as leader of the Blue Eagle Scouts!</p>

    <p>Profile: Gale was on a missionary trip to Nunavut with her parents when a freak lightning storm caused the plane to crash. Gale was tragically the only survivor, but upon awakening she found she had obtained the ability to control the wind, perhaps owing to the improbium aboard the plane during the crash. This ability allowed her to survive the wilderness and ultimately reach civilization. She has since been placed under the legal guardianship of mayoral candidate Blue Eagle, who sent her to Halcyon Academy to join the Blue Eagle Scouts.</p>

    <p>Profile: Daughter of the supervillain Diceman, young Felicity was dragged into her father's criminal activity. This was not what ultimately led to her arrest however. That came after she adopted the codename "Cheat" and engaged in vigilante activity to foil not only her father but his various accomplices. During this time she used her powers to grant good or bad luck to combat not only her father but also the police officers and heroes who attempted to arrest him. Ultimately both were captured. Because Diceman was never successful in any serious crimes, he has been placed on house arrest, and Felicity obtained parole with community service under the guidance of Blue Eagle.</p>
